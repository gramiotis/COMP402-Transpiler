# Transplier from imaginary language Theta to C
This transpiler only covers the lexical and syntax analysis of a program written in the Theta language. More info 
about the syntax of the Theta language can be found [here](./https://github.com/gramiotis/COMP402-Transpiler/blob/main/Documentation-in-English.pdf).

## Usage
To run the transpiler execute the `test.sh` script which compiles the lexical and syntaxt analyzer into an executable.
The executable runs automatically in the script and tests two examples provided in the *src* folder.
